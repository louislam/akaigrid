## Motivation

I used Jellyfin and Chromecast (with Google TV) to stream videos to my TV for a while. Jellyfin is great, but I faced issues with subtitles, fonts, naming, and audio sync. At times, I spent more time
fixing problems than enjoying videos.

Recently, I switched to a Windows mini PC (Intel N100 CPU) as my "video player" in my living room. With MPC-HC and K-Lite Codec Pack, this combo plays videos smoothly with minimal issues, and the
performance is much better than Chromecast.

However, there aren‚Äôt many frontends for managing videos on Windows. So, I decided to create one.

I also wanted to try developing with Deno 2 and learn the Vue 3 Composition API in this project.

## FAQ

### Akai?

Akai (Ëµ§„ÅÑ / „ÅÇ„Åã„ÅÑ / a-ka-i) is a Japanese word meaning "red". It is an adjective. So AkaiGrid means "Red Grid".

Why red? I don't know, but some popular online video platforms are also red, haha.

### How to refresh cached thumbnails in browser?

Ctrl + F5 in your browser.

### Can I use it on my phone?

No.

### Can I use it on Mac/Linux Desktop?

No. AkaiGrid is built for Windows. For other systems, someone else would need to fork it.

### Jellyfin replacement?

No. AkaiGrid focuses on displaying your video libraries on Windows and relies on video players like MPC-HC for playback.

If you want to stream videos to your phone or play music, you may still need Jellyfin.
